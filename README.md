## Fault Detection for sensor systems
This is a machine learning model to predict quality of semiconductor wafers based on sensor readings collected during fabrication process.
Goal is to build a model that can accuratly predict wheather a wafer is good or bad based on sensor readings.This help in early detection of defective wafers improving yeild and reducing waste in semiconductor manufacturing process.
